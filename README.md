# ELC-Summary
Converts a Southern Ontario Land Resource Information System (SOLRIS) raster HTML report from QGIS to a CSV

Save the .html raster report that is generated when running the "Raster Layer Unique Report" in QGIS.

Run the script and use the dialogue box to point to the .html file.

The modified is now saved in your directory as ELC_Summary.csv.

*Note* this script will work for all .html tables, but a dictionary is coded specifically for use with the Southern Ontario Land Resource Information System data.
